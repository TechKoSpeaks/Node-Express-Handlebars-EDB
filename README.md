## Description 

* This is a burger based restaurant application that allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Any time the user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
